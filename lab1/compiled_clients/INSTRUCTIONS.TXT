These clients are compiled and you can use them to test how tftp works.
They come compiled for two different architectures found on the schhols unix system, x86 and SPARC.
In order to know which arcitecture you are running on type the following into a terminal

uname -a

then you will see something like this,

SunOS hamberg.it.uu.se 5.10 Generic_148888-04 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-80

indicating that you are running on SPARC for example.

If you are sitting in P1515 you are likely running on x86 and if you are login in via
ssh you are likely running on SPARC.
To run the program type

./tftp_69_SPARC -g medium.pdf joshua.it.uu.se
